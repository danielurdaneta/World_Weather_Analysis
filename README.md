# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

 The purpose of this project was to make an app that creates 2000 random latitudes and longitudes, find the nearest cities for those coordinates, retrieve weather information between specific temperature parameters, find the nearest hotel and creates maps that help the client to make decisions about his next travel. We did this using Python, Pandas, and APIs.
 
 In the following image we can see the world map with markers on over 110 cities that in the time of search had a temperature between 60 and 70 Â°F:

As we can see, there is also a description of the nearest hotel and a weather description for each marker.

In the following image we can see an example of a vacation itinerary if the client decided on a trip in Spain based on their climate and hotel preferences:

As we can see, the application delivers the optimal route depending on the method of transport, in this case, by car.
