# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

 The purpose of this project was to make an app that creates 2000 random latitudes and longitudes, find the nearest cities for those coordinates, retrieve weather information between specific temperature parameters, find the nearest hotel and creates maps that help the client to make decisions about his next travel.
